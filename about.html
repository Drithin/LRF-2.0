                  <p>The Latha Raja Foundation was established in the year of 2015 in order to honour the memory of Smt. K. S. S. Latha, Director, Exotic Events. <br> <br>

                    The foundation focuses on providing financial aid for educational requirements of students in need, acts as the platform for talented artists 
                    to promote and showcase a variety of lesser-known art forms. A lot of importance has been given to create awareness about a broad area of socially
                     relevant content by publishing and distributing books for free. We have extended our support to other organizations which work towards the welfare of the society. 
                    We also recognize the effects of such organizations at the national and state levels through the Seva Dharmik Awards. <br> <br>
                    
                    The foundation has recently acquired its name but was giving back to society for the last thirty years under the title of “Chaitanya Art Theaters” - a social and cultural organization. <br> <br>
